# Javascript Code Quiz

## Description

The Javascript Code Quiz is a five question quiz on Javascript. The questions and answers
are stored as objects in an array. When the start button is clicked the first question
appears and the 30 second timer begins its countdown. 

The user can choose the answer by clicking the corresponding button. When they select the 
answer and alert will pop up and show Correct Answer or Incorrect Answer. Then the next question
appears. The game ends after the fifth question or when the timer reaches zero. The functionality
of this acheieved by grabbing elements from the HTML, looping and adding an event listener.

The score is supposed to appear in the Score input and when user types initials and hits
the Save button, they should be saved. However, I was unable to make this work at 
this time.
